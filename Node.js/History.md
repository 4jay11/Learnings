# Node.js

## What is Node.js?

- **Node.js** is a free, open-source tool that lets you use **JavaScript** to build programs that can run on a server, not just in a web browser.  
- It works on many systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix.  
- It uses Google’s **V8 engine** (the part of Google Chrome that runs JavaScript), making JavaScript fast and powerful.  
- Node.js is designed to handle many tasks at the same time without waiting for one task to finish. This is called **non-blocking** or **asynchronous**.  
- The **OpenJS Foundation** manages and supports the development of Node.js.

## How Did Node.js Start?

### The Beginning  

- Node.js was created by **Ryan Dahl** in **2009**.  
- Ryan noticed a problem with traditional web servers like **Apache**, which couldn’t handle many tasks at the same time efficiently.  
- To fix this, he created Node.js to manage multiple requests without slowing down.  

### Building Node.js  

1. **First Steps**:  
   - Ryan started using the **SpiderMonkey engine** (from Firefox) to run JavaScript but found it didn’t work well for his needs.  
   - He switched to Google’s **V8 engine**, which was faster, and continued building Node.js with it.  

2. **Name Change**:  
   - The project was first called **web.js** because it was made to build web servers.  
   - Ryan later renamed it **Node.js** when he realized it could be used for much more than just web servers.  

### Joining Joyent  

- Around the same time, a company called **Joyent** was working on a similar idea: using JavaScript on servers.  
- Joyent asked Ryan to work with them. They provided funding and resources, helping Node.js grow and improve.

## Key Events in Node.js History

- **2010**: Introduction of **npm** (Node Package Manager), a registry where developers can publish and share open-source packages, simplifying code reuse.
- **2011**: Initially, Node.js supported only macOS and Linux. Collaboration between Windows and Joyent led to Windows support for Node.js, expanding its accessibility.
- **2012**: Ryan Dahl stepped down from the project, and **Isaac Schlueter**, the creator of npm, assumed leadership. Post-Ryan's departure, development slowed, struggling to keep pace with updates to the V8 engine.
- **2014**: **Fedor Indutny**, a contributor, forked the project, creating **io.js**, maintained by a small team aiming for more rapid development and up-to-date V8 integration.
- **2015**: The Node.js Foundation was established under the Linux Foundation. Both io.js and Node.js merged back together, unifying the community and development efforts.
- **2019**: The **JS Foundation** and **Node.js Foundation** merged to form the **OpenJS Foundation**, which now oversees Node.js's active development.
