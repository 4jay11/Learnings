### JavaScript on Server

- JavaScript, originally used for client-side programming, can now run outside the browser.
- Node.js allows JavaScript to execute on servers, enabling backend development and more.

### What is a Server?

- A server can be either **hardware** or **software**:
  - **Hardware server**: A physical machine used to host websites, databases, and applications.
  - **Software server**: A program that listens for client requests and sends back responses.

- **Before Node.js**: JavaScript was limited to client-side scripting in browsers.
- **After Node.js**: JavaScript became a powerful tool for server-side development.

### V8 JavaScript Engine

- **What is V8?**
  - V8 is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google.
  - Written in **C++**, it powers both **Google Chrome** and **Node.js**.

- **Key Features**:
  - Implements the **ECMAScript** standard for scripting languages like JavaScript.
  - Can run on different operating systems (cross-platform).
  - Can be embedded into any C++ application for running JavaScript.

- **JavaScript Engines**:
  - JavaScript engines follow ECMAScript standards to execute code:
    - **V8**: Used in Chrome and Node.js (by Google).
    - **SpiderMonkey**: Used in Mozilla Firefox.
    - **Chakra**: Used in Microsoft Edge.
    - **JavaScriptCore**: Used in Apple Safari.

### Node.js

- **What is Node.js?**
  - Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.
  - It uses V8 to convert JavaScript into machine code but adds libraries (e.g., libuv) to handle features like file system access, networking, and more.

- **Structure of Node.js**:

- **Why is V8 Important?**
- V8 only converts JavaScript to machine code.
- V8 alone cannot handle tasks like interacting with files, databases, or the operating system.

### How JavaScript is Executed

1. **JavaScript Code**: Written by developers in a high-level language.
2. **V8 Engine**: Converts JavaScript into **machine code**.
3. **Machine Code**: Executed by the CPU.

- **Execution Flow**:

JavaScript -> High-Level Language (C++ in V8) -> Machine Code -> Assembly Code -> Binary Code


- **Machine Code**:
- Also called **machine language**.
- It is the basic language that a computerâ€™s CPU can directly read and execute.

- **ECMAScript**:
- A standardized scripting language specification.
- JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript are based on ECMAScript.

- **Why Use Node.js?**
- Handles asynchronous operations efficiently.
- Enables full-stack JavaScript development (frontend and backend).
- Has a vast ecosystem of libraries (NPM).

- **V8 Performance**:
- Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- Uses techniques like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to improve runtime performance.
